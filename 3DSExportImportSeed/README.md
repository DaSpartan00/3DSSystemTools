# Move Console or Export/Import Movable SEED

Uses [service-patch](https://github.com/archshift/service-patch) and [libkhax](https://github.com/Myriachan/libkhax) to do manual system transfer.

On your old system, run this tool and press X to export the seed.

On your new system, place "export_seed.bin" on your SD card and run this tool.

You may want to format your system first. Press select to do so. There is no confirmation prompt! Pressing select WILL format your system to factory settings.

Press Y to import the seed.

Press A to import SecureInfo (extracted from another console's NAND dump)

Turn the system off.
